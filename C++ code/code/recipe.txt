TECHNOLOGY USED:
* HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or
  codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet.
  The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's
  documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, and images etc.
  
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
  It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts,
  thus making our web pages presentable to the users.
  It is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

* JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
  (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).
* Bootstrap and CSS3 to build the UI of the application. Bootstrap is very useful in saving up time as it has many components ready for use and very extensive documentation.
  Node.js is a server-side platform built on google chromeâ€™s javascript V8 engine for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js.

* We have used MongoDB as the database. It is extremely simple to install and implement. MongoDB uses JSON or BSON documents to store data.
  Finally, we have used Heroku to deploy our application.

CHALLENGES FACED:
* Structuring the database correctly was bit of a challenge,
  redundant collections were logically getting created or linking one
  collection to another was logically not possible.

* Implementation cloudinary and multer was new and slightly difficult.

FUTURE SCOPE:
* The application could be more interactive and intuitive.
* Implementaion a global search bar with filters like difficulty level,cuisine etc.
* I would like to add social media sharing buttons and singning up with social media account.
